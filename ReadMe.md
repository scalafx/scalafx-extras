ScalaFX Extras
==============

Additions to ScalaFX that do not have corresponding concepts in JavaFX. The key parts are helper methods in `org.scalafx.extras` and support for a working with Model-View and FXML.

Module `scalafx-extras-demos` has a demo StopWatch application that illustrates uses of the Model-View and FXML API.


ScalaFX Extras is still quite experimental and APIs may change significantly.

To use ScalaFX Extras with SBT add following dependency:

```
libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx-extras" % "0.1.0"
```
