### ScalaFX-Extras Release v.0.2.0

This a feature release, several new concepts were added:

* The mixin `ShowMessage` makes it easier to display dialogs.
* The `BusyWorker` helps running UI tasks a separate threads (other than the JavaFX Application thread).
  It gives an option to show progress and status messages.
* The `ImageDisplay` component for showing images with ability to zoom in, zoom out, zoom to fit. 
  It can also automatically resizes to parent size.
  
There were also significant changes to the Model-View-X pattern code. 
The `View` changed name to `ControllerFX` to match naming used in JavaFX. 
`Model` was renamed to `ModelFX`.
`ModelView` was renamed to `MVCfx`. 
There were some other changed for smoother integration with the new `ShowMessage` and `BusyWorker` classes. 
The ending `FX` was added to avoid conflicts with ScalaFXML macros clashing with name `Controller`.

The are new demos, in `scalafx-extras-demos` project that illustrate the use of the `scalafx-extras` features.
