## ScalaFX-Extras Release v.0.9.0

This release of [ScalaFX-Extras]  is mostly a bug fix release. Some small tweak to `BusyWorker` was required to resolve
the issue with double error dialogs.

### New features

* Add helper method for finding parent windows for nodes [[#29]]

### Bug fixes

* FileSelectionField - editing text field is difficult - cursor jumps to the end after each keystroke [[#27]]
* Error handling implemented in `SimpleTask` is disabled in `BusyWorker#_doTask` [[#28]]

### Breaking Changes

* `org.scalafx.extras.BusyWorker.SimpleTask` API changed to respect overrides
  of `onSucceeded`, `onCancelled`, `onFailed` that were ignored. Issue [[#28]].
